        <p>This is my homepage for the course. I have a wonderful wife and 3 kids who are wonderful on most days.
            I enjoy hiking and serving as an ordinance worker in the Tucson Temple. Why don't skeletons fight each
            other?
            Because they don't have the guts! HA!.</p>

        <p>I live in Arizona, the Grand Canyon State. It is known for its desert climate and beautiful landscapes.
            The Sonoran Desert is home to unique flora and fauna, including the iconic saguaro cactus. Arizona also
            boasts stunning natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the
            Seven Natural Wonders of the World.</p>
